# ITC Second Week challenge

This week we gonna take you far away from the web dev area to the pure coding area where we gonna test your knowledge of some basic necessary concepts that every programmer should know about 

the challenge is "beginners friendly" meaning anyone with basic knowledge can participate 

**GOOD LUCK <3**

## Welcome

Thanks for checking out this week's coding challenge.

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of DSA- Data Structures and Algorithms, Sorting Algorithms, and a programming language**


## Where to find everything

Here you can find links that are going to help you in doing this challenge:

**Complexity**

Computer scientists use mathematical measures of complexity that allow them to predict, before writing the code, how fast an algorithm will run and how much memory it will require. Such predictions are important guides for programmers implementing and selecting algorithms for real-world applications.

**Sorting Algorithms**

A sorting algorithm is used to arrange elements of an array/list in a specific order.
